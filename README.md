# Project 2: Social Media Analyzer

## Restaurant Comparison Tool
This tool utilizes Twitter and Google NLP API to compare sentiment towards two restaurants. When run, the script `proj2.py` prompts the user to enter two different restaurant names. It then searches for tweets based on the names entered and calculates the average sentiment scores for each restaurant across the lists of tweets obtained. The resulting output displays which restaurant people seem to prefer more based on these average scores.
